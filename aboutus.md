subtitle: Who we are and why we are here

Welcome to the World Of EUC! This community has been alive and kicking for a while now, with over 2200 registered users in our slack channel. There are some of the best and brightest minds in the community active and contributing.

We are self managed community with no commercial hangups or ties. As such, everything we do, we find a way to do it for free - inclusive of this site, which is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the awesome [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/)

## Who we are

We are a world of technology specialists, end users, consultants and developers. We are vendor and platform agnostic.

We are all things EUC. We are community.

## Admin help and support

Whilst we are an open community platform, there are currently 4 admins who can help you with requests and guidance as needed:

*  [Jarian Gibson](https://twitter.com/JarianGibson) - USA
*  [James Kindon](https://twitter.com/james_kindon) - Australia
*  [Ryan Revord](https://twitter.com/rsrevord) - USA
*  [Dave Brett](https://twitter.com/dbretty) - UK

## Why we are here

Our aim is to provide a central and community based platform to allow like minded individuals across the globe to collaborate with each other.

We also aim to offer an environment for all vendors, products, solution providers to participate in active communications with end users, in whatever level they feel is appropriate. We have active product managers from select technology providers who are  involved in these channels.

No tricks, no BS, no politics, no allegiances to anything other than open sharing.

## Where we came from

There are many great community initiatives out there. Many of these initiatives existed within unique and individual slack channels or private forums. So far we have consolidated the following resources into the world of EUC:

| **Resource** | **Previous Platform**
| World of WEM | Slack
| FSLogix Community | Slack
| Labrats | Slack
| Citrix IRC | Slack
| NetScaler Rocks | Slack
| EUC Monitoring | Slack

## Rules of engagement

*  **We will not tolderate abuse, politics or any form of crap against another member of this community**
*  We aim to, and will consistently ask you to utilise threads within the slack channels. We expect a level of professionalism and courtesy - **threads are critical**

## Platform

### Slack

We currently operate using the Slack platform. It's not perfect but it provides a uniformly understood solution that is easy to drive.

We structure our channels in a simple and easy to follow method:

*  Channels prefixed with an underscore ("**_**") are general discussion channels within a certain criteria - think General chat, Community events, GPU discussions etc
*  Channels prefixed with a dash ("**-**") are for community driven initiatives and projects - think BIS-F, PowerScale, EUCMonitoring
*  All other channels with no prefix are vendor or technology specific - think ControlUp, Citrix Cloud, Microsoft FSLogix or Nutanix

### Discord

We bridge our slack environment into the Discord platform so that we have an archive capability. The free slack tier is limited in it's history retention, the more conversations that go on, the less that is retained - Discord helps us bridge this, and if you are discord fan, we bridge both ways.

Please be cognizant of the different way that platforms user threads

### Github Pages

We are active building a web platform (this one) to allow for a central blog site for those that may want to contribute but don't have their own platform. There will be instructions and guidance provided as we mature, but everything will be based on GitHub pages and the beautiful Jekyll baseline as noted above.

Github release processes will be the core of how we manage this site moving forward.

## How to get involved

We are not currently sponsored. The platform is funded where required by the community.

If you would like to join, we have a standing open invite link [here](https://t.co/EVrMXepANH)

If anyone has ideas or contributions they would like to add to this community, we are open. We welcome input and contributions in any way, however our core focus will be one of community and we will keep to that core above anything else. Should you wish to contribute and help in any way, do so knowing that we will not push any particular solution or technology.
