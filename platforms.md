## Slack

We currently operate using the Slack platform.

We structure our channels in a simple and easy to follow method:

-  Channels prefixed with an underscore (`_`) are general discussion channels within a certain criterion - think General chat, Community events, GPU discussions etc.
-  Channels prefixed with a dash (`-`) are for community driven initiatives and projects - think BIS-F etc.
-  All other channels with no prefix are vendor or technology specific - think ControlUp, Citrix Cloud, Microsoft FSLogix or Nutanix etc.

If you would like to join, we have a standing [open invite link here](https://join.slack.com/t/worldofeuc/shared_invite/zt-dexotib9-vL0IzKmh9QhPrGxE8LotAA).

## Linen

We archive slack content to [linen.dev](https://www.linen.dev/s/worldofeuc) so that there is record available for content older than 90 days.

## Discord

We have a current bridge to Discord. We ask discord users to respect the use of threads. [Discord](https://t.co/Qpn5XNsjgH)
