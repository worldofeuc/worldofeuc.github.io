This is the official first post on our community site. Welcome to the party. Hopefully content grows and people find a home here to post technical blogs where they don't have their own hosting.

We use a combination of simple technology to make this work:

*  [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
*  [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/)
*  [Utterance for comments](https://github.com/utterance/utterances)
*  [Markdown for everything](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

The site is managed and maintained using github release proceses, submit a pull request with your blog, we will review and release. We will post guidelines and templates to help with consistency and content creation.

Rinse. Repeat. Win.
