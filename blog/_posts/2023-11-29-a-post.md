## Intro

This is a very basic post on how to post for World of EuC posts. Note that this is an Intro section telling you what it's about.

## Content

In this section, we are going to show some content examples. Pretty exciting. You can use an emoji to express your excitement. ðŸ˜œ

Here are some basic bullet points:

-  Here is a bullet outlining what a bullet looks like
-  Here is another bullet doing the same thing as above

Everyone loves tables, you can add tables in markdown, below is an example of a normal table

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| An Entry | With a value |
| Another Entry | With another value |

I can make this table smallover if needed

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| An Entry | With a value |
| Another Entry | With another value |
{:.smaller}

I can also control alignment of the data. See if you can spot how.

| Item | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| An Entry | With a value |
| Another Entry | With another value |
{:.smaller}

### Sub heading with Image

Under this sub heading, you can see an example of how we nest an image.

[![Image Summary]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/blog/a-draft-post-used-for-how-to-blog/Image1.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/a-draft-post-used-for-how-to-blog/Image1.jpg)

### Code Snippets

Don't post entire scripts in blogs, it's nasty. Use a code repository to store code. But feel free to paste simple snippets or reference code snippets using a code block:

~~~PowerShell
foreach ($Thing in $Things) { 
  Write-Host "This thing is a $($thing)"
}
~~~

That is some complex PowerShell right there

### Featured Categories

In this post, we have defined three featured Categories:

-  **`Demo Author`**. This is who I am, and will be a featured category that can be clicked on, to show all posts by me, Demo_Author. Note that for organisation simplicity, we name the featured category for authors as `Author_Demo` but have the value as `Demo_Author`. This just helps those of us with slight OCD.
-  **`Example`**. This is a silly tag which is not featured. It is not indexed and is simply constrained to the post. If it needed to be indexable, we would need to create a featured category.
-  **`Blogging`**. This is similar to the `Demo_Author` category. Any post tagged with `Blogging` as a Category in it's front matter, will now be grouped under this Category.

### Author

The `Author` value in the post front matter is linked to `Guest1`. Note that at the bottom of this post, it gives you some info about who I am. The Author details are contained in the `_data/authors.yml` file. If the Author is not defined, the post won't show the correct author.

### Your Post Link

Your post will be given a unique url based on the `permalink` value in your front matter. This post, will forever be known as [https://worldofeuc.com/a-draft-post-used-for-how-to-blog](https://worldofeuc.com/a-draft-post-used-for-how-to-blog). Not bad.

## Summary

Hopefully there was some help in this post structure, and now you understand how we do what we do and how to get going with blogs.
