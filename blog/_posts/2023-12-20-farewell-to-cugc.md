The Citrix User Group Community has been a stable backbone for many of us over the years, it’s a community that whilst focused on Citrix, created so much more than a bunch of Citrix geeks talking about remoting.

It is a community body which provided the average human a place to meet others, provided startups the ability to showcase their tech, provided community members a place to share their content including live events, webinars, and the all-important blog, and brought people from all over the world together based on a similar set of passions.

For good, or for bad, Citrix have taken back control of the CUGC community and will manage it's content and structures moving forward with it's own agenda. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it of course means change.

We founded the World of EUC community years ago with a single purpose of providing a central platform to share technical knowledge. Over the years the community has grown to a current 2,891 members according to Slack, along with who knows how many via Discord and the integration we via the bridge between CUGC and World of EUC Slack communities. It has turned into a pretty great place to get a technical hand.

The World of EUC community is not going to replace what CUGC created, however we invite and welcome anyone to join and take part in the conversations that are always happening.

We are [enhancing the offering](/platforms/) with more than just a free Slack instance (and archive to linen.dev) by offering a home for [technical blogging](/howtoblog/). We have revamped the site and will do our best to keep things current and relevant.

If there is content you would like to share, but don’t have your own site, you are welcome to contribute. We also encourage those who own their content currently published on CUGC to consider re-homing it here.

We love in-person events as much as everyone else, but in the absence of those, we can try and offer some virtual fun. We plan on expanding out to host some virtual technical sessions in the not-too-distant future (time permitting of course).

So as the sun sets on CUGC for now, we say thanks for the ride. You will be missed and should be proud of the impact you made on lives across the globe.

Whilst we can’t replace what has been lost, we can offer a small place for the technical minded to come and hang out. [Be welcome](/about/).

James, Jarian, Dave, Ryan.
