# About

<!--author-->

{:toc .large-only}

## Why we are here

Our aim is to provide a central and community based platform to allow like minded individuals across the globe to collaborate with each other.

We also aim to offer an environment for all vendors, products, solution providers to participate in active communications with end users, in whatever level they feel is appropriate. We have active product managers who are actively involved in these channels.

No tricks, no BS, no politics, no allegiances to anything other than open sharing.

## Blogging

You are welcome to contribute blogs to the worldofeuc website. See the following page for details on [blogging](/howtoblog/).

## Where we came from

There are many great community initiatives out there. Many of these initiatives existed within unique and individual slack channels or private forums. So far we have consolidated the following resources into the world of EUC:

| Resource | Previous Platform |
| :--- | :--- |
| World of WEM | Slack |
| FSLogix Community | Slack |
| Labrats | Slack |
| Citrix IRC | Slack |
| NetScaler Rocks | Slack |
| EUC Monitoring | Slack |

## Rules of engagement

-  We will **not** tolderate abuse against another member of this community.
-  We aim to, and will consistently ask you to utilise threads within the slack channels. We expect a level of professionalism and courtesy - *threads are critical*.
-  Be respectful. Keep your opinions to yourself if they don't make the world a better place. You are welcome to your negativity, you are not welcome to impose it on others.

If you do not thread, your content **will** be deleted.
{:.note title="Attention"}

## Platform

We currently operate using the Slack platform.

We archive slack content to [linen.dev](https://www.linen.dev/s/worldofeuc) so that there is record available for content older than 90 days.

We structure our channels in a simple and easy to follow method:

-  Channels prefixed with an underscore (`_`) are general discussion channels within a certain criteria - think General chat, Community events, GPU discussions etc.
-  Channels prefixed with a dash (`-`) are for community driven initiatives and projects - think BIS-F etc.
-  All other channels with no prefix are vendor or technology specific - think ControlUp, Citrix Cloud, Microsoft FSLogix or Nutanix etc.

We have a current bridge to Discord. We ask discord users to respect the use of threads.

We host this site, and any associated blog posts on Github Pages.

## How to get involved

We are not currently sponsored. The platform is funded where required by the community.

If you would like to join, we have a standing [open invite link here](https://t.co/UEBgTHRDXF).

If anyone has ideas or contributions they would like to add to this community, we are open to suggestions.

We welcome input and contributions in any way, however our core focus will be one of community and we will keep to that core above anything else. Should you wish to contribute and help in any way, do so knowing that we will not push any particular solution or technology.
