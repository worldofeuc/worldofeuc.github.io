# About

-  Table of Contents
{:toc .large-only}

We are a world of technology specialists, end users, consultants and developers. We are vendor and platform agnostic and all things EUC.

## Why we are here

Our aim is to provide a central and community based platform to allow like-minded individuals across the globe to collaborate with each other.

We also aim to offer an environment for all vendors, products, solution providers to participate in active communications with end users, in whatever level they feel is appropriate. We have active product managers who are involved in these channels.

No tricks, no BS, no politics, no allegiances to anything other than open sharing.

## Blogging

You are welcome to contribute blogs to the **World Of EUC** website. See the following page for details on [blogging](/howtoblog/).

## Where we came from

There are many great community initiatives out there. Many of these initiatives existed within unique and individual slack channels or private forums. So far we have consolidated the following resources into the world of EUC:

## Rules of engagement

-  We will **NOT** tolerate abuse against another member of this community.
-  We aim to, and will consistently ask you to utilize threads within the slack channels and expect a level of professionalism and courtesy - *threads are critical*.
-  Be respectful. Keep your opinions to yourself if they don't make the world a better place. You are welcome to your negativity, you are not welcome to impose it on others.
-  Be inclusive. Don't exclude individuals from a conversation, you never know, you might learn something new.

If you do not thread, your content **will** be deleted.

If anyone has ideas or contributions they would like to add to this community, we are open to suggestions.

We welcome input and contributions in any way, however our core focus will be one of community, and we will keep to that core above anything else. Should you wish to contribute and help in any way, do so knowing that we will not push any particular solution or technology.
